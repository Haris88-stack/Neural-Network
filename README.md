# Neural-Network
The goal of this project is to predict Airbnb rental price per night in Paris based on the following features: Neighborhood, RoomType, Bathrooms, Bedrooms, GuestsIncluded, MinimumNights, NumberOfReviews, and ReviewScoresRating. The dataset used here was generated by ChatGPT to mimic real data and does not contain actual Airbnb listings. The model employs neural network and tensorflow to find the optimal parameters (weights and bias). The dataset used in this project is available in the folder and is named "airbnb_listings_paris_realistic.csv". Enjoy reading!
